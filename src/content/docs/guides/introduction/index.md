GarlicOS is a custom firmware for Anbernic RG-35xx line of devices.
It is made by [Black-Seraph](https://www.patreon.com/blackseraph).

It's a fast & easy to understand operating system that should make Miyoo Mini / OnionOS users feel right at home with its similar look & feel!

Think of it as the natural evolution of my previous RetroArch port for RG35XX, with fully working sleep mode, improved button mappings, a whole new user interface and several under-the-hood bugfixes.

You can check more information and download the latest version of GarlicOs from its [official website](https://www.patreon.com/blackseraph).
